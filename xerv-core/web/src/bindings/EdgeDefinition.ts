 * An edge definition connecting nodes in a flow.
 *
 * Edges can be specified in several formats:
 *
 * # Simple format (default ports)
 * ```yaml
 * edges:
 *   - from: node_a
 *     to: node_b
 * ```
 *
 * # With explicit ports
 * ```yaml
 * edges:
 *   - from: switch_node.true
 *     to: handler_node.in
 *   - from: switch_node.false
 *     to: error_handler.in
 * ```
 *
 * # With conditions
 * ```yaml
 * edges:
 *   - from: node_a.out
 *     to: node_b.in
 *     condition: "${node_a.status} == 'success'"
 * ```
